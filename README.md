# My custom Firefox UI styles

This is a content of my Firefox "chrome" folder with custom css. It is mostly consists of amazing [CustomCSSforFx](https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx) project + couple small tweaks and css from other sources. 

The goal of this specific styles is to bring classic Firefox look. My main focus was tabs and url bar. But there are some other tweaks.

I wanted to share it because CustomCSSforFx could be a little overwhelming:) So if you like my Firefox look (check screenshot) that you can just use mine.

**How to apply styles**

Just copy paste all files to your Firefox chrome folder in browser profile folder. To find it type about:support in address bar. Find Profile Folder > click on Open folder. There you'll find chrome folder.

userChrome.css - this is main file for css styles. But this version imports (connects) other files.

**userContent.css**

I also threw here my version on userContent.css. Unlike userChrome.css this file changes pages content. But it can also change Firefox devtools. 

I have two tweaks there. Change Segoi UI font to Arial. I just hate it:) But you can change it to anything you have on your pc.

Second tweak is for devtools. It removes breadcrumbs which always disturbs me.

If you don't need any of that just ignore this file.
